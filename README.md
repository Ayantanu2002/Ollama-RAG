# Ollama-RAG

Ollama-RAG is a project that demonstrates the use of the **Ollama** model in different types of chat systems and frameworks. The project is organized into three main parts:

1. **Basic Chat System** - A simple chat interface using the Ollama model.
2. **Multimodal Chat System** - A chat system that handles both text and image inputs using Ollama.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System** - A system that answers queries using web data, specifically Wikipedia articles, in combination with the Ollama model.
